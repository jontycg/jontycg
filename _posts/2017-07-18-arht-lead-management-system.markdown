description: During my time at the Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust as a telemarketer (my part time job through most of university), I observed how slow and inefficient the paper systems were for dealing with leads. I had ideas for how I could go about designing a better digital system and so I approached my boss to ask if I had permission to try.<p>I developed it for a very long period of time and in the end, the system could recieve leads in CSV format, reformat the CSV document to be read by the LMS (Lead Management System) and display these leads to the telemarketers. These leads could also be viewed and sorted in a listview. There was also functionality for setting reminders as well as notes and comments about any past attempts to contact the lead.<p>The LMS was completely functional and was used by both the community fundraising team as well as the corporate fundraising team.<p>The LMS was developed entirely in C#
