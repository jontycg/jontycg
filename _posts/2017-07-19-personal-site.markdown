description: I made this site using Jekyll, a static site building tool that is supported by Github Pages. I used the Freelancer theme to get a nice starting off point although I've edited a fair bit now to better suit my needs. The source for this can be found at <a href = "https://github.com/jontycg/jontycg.github.io"> https://github.com/jontycg/jontycg.github.io</a> but keep in mind that the majority of it is part of the Freelancer theme and I have only made small tweaks to it by comparison. This site shouldn't be taken as a demonstration of my developing skills because Jekyll is very easy to use and I have only made very small tweaks to the templates and CSS. This site is purely a place online that I can use to showcase projects I have developed myself due to many of my projects being privately listed on Github.
