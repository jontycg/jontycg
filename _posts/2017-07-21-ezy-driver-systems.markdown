description: My largest project to date is the system that I am currently developing part time for Ezy Driver Limited. The goal of the project was to convert the paper systems for job and shift logging into digital ones so that paying the drivers can be automated.<p>The project started by creating an Android application to be used on a company issued tablet by the drivers. From here, job and shift information is synced in real-time via Firebase with a Web Portal to be used by the Ezy Driver Dispatcher.The Web Portal which was built using Node.js, Firebase and Angular (2+) shows dispatch in real-time the status of each driver at any moment. It also allows the admin team to generate a CSV of shift information for the drivers which is then submitted to Xero to pay them.<p>This project will be beta tested in August 2017. Future improvements will allow for job assignment from the Web Portal as well as chat functionality between the driver and dispatch.<p>This project is listed privately on my Github however I am happy to give a demonstration and show code in person.<p>For an album of screenshots of the Android app and Web Portal <a href = "http://imgur.com/a/glQsJ">check here.</a>
